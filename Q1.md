# Rules of Big O Notation with Examples  

## 1. Worst Case
      Always use the worst case.
     Example: Looking up in a list is O(1) (best case) if it's in front, but O(n) (worst case) if it's in back.
    We use O(n) (worst case).
## 2. Remove Constants
     Don't omit constant values when calculating complexity.
     Example: If an algorithm is O(n/2 + n + 5), we drop the constants to get down to O(n).
## 3. Different Inputs, Different Variables
      If there's more than one independent input going into the function, then use distinct variables.
    Example: Do not write O(n²), write O(a * b) for two different-sized lists which are independent of each other.
## 4. Remove Non-Dominant Terms
    Remove the non-dominant term only.
     Example: For O(n + n²), remove O(n) and write O(n²).
