# Differentiate between arrays and linked lists in terms of:
   #### **Memory Allocation**

    Arrays utilize fixed, contiguous blocks of memory.

    Linked lists utilize dynamically, separately allocated memory blocks.

   #### **Speed**

     Arrays provide O(1) time constant index-based access.

    Linked listsneed sequential access, so access is O(n).

   #### **Insertion & Deletion**

     Arrays contain costly operations (O(n)) due to element shifting.

    Linked lists have the ability to do quick updates (O(1) in the best case) by re-pointing.
